# SpaceCombatUnityProject

We're not but poor students so if you steal our code, well, not much we can do about it but complain. So mostly I guess use this for whatever you want.

However if you do something disgusting like rebuild our game but add your own ads/micro transactions, then this code is technically under the Apache 2.0 license and you have to credit us as the original authors.

built with Unity 2018.3
