	The team who created Star Cooler Carnage does not wish to collect any of your data (although we are sure you are a very interesting person &hellip; it's not you, it's us).
	<br><br><br><br>
	But&hellip; This game was made with Unity and they collect some device information to stay on top of the types of hardware they need to support:
